# Etherscan_visualization

This repo will try different visualizations for the data published at https://etherscan.io/charts.

With univariate dataset, I plot line chart, table, heatmap, boxplot, violinplot, EDCF and partial autocorrelation.
With multivariate dataset, I plot multiple time-series line charts, correlation heatmap.
